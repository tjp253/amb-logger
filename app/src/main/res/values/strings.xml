    <string name="disclosure">This is where the disclosure agreement will go once the wording has been finalised.
        \n\nUnless the user scrolls to the bottom of the agreement and ticks the box, the \'accept\' button is disabled.
        \n\nFor all new users, the disclosure agreement will appear when they first start the app - before any sensors have been
        identified and before their Unique ID is assigned.
        \n\nIn the same way the Unique ID only gets set once, the disclosure agreement will not show after the first time starting
        the app (unless the user declines to accept, in which case they won\'t get past the agreement no matter how many times they
        restart the app.
        \n\n\nWhile I have looked at the Google Play guidelines and also read through the privacy policy you wrote, I am unsure what to
        put in the final agreement as I haven\'t dealt with them before.
        \n\n\nAs you can probably tell, I am waffling.
        \n\n\nThis is to allow you to see how the user needs to scroll down before being able to progress.
        \n\nTry the \'back\' button if you wish. . .
        \n\nAny luck? The answer should be no.
        \n\nWhile there is no way of ensuring users actually READ the agreement, this makes it slightly more likely!
        \n\nAnd now you can check the box and accept the agreement.

    <string name="privacy_policy"><b>Data collection</b>
        \n\nThe CradleRide logger app is a research tool for collecting sensor data from phones. The sensor data is not collected
        automatically. It will only start with direct user intervention.

        \n\nThe data collected depends on the features available on the phone being used, but can include:
        \n\tAccelerometer data, sampled at the fastest rate
        \n\tGyroscope data, sampled at the fastest rate
        \n\tGPS position data, sampled at approximately 1Hz
        \n\tAudio data, sampled at 100-200Hz - the highest amplitude component within the sampling time window only

        \n\nA unique identifier is used per phone, so that multiple uses of the same phone can be correlated and combined.

        \n\nAll data is saved on the phone locally, then after the user stops the logging session and the phone subsequently
        enters a WiFi zone, the saved data is uploaded to our servers only.

        \n\nThe data saved on our server will not be shared with any third party without further consultation with the users.

        \n\nThe data from multiple logging events from the same user will be combined to produce aggregate data about the
        environment in which the user is located, but not about the user themselves.

        \n\nAll data is transmitted securely.\n</string>
