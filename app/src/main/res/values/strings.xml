    <string name="privacy_policy"><b>Data collection</b>
        \n\nThe CradleRide logger app is a research tool for collecting sensor data from phones. The sensor data is not collected
        automatically. It will only start with direct user intervention.

        \n\nThe data collected depends on the features available on the phone being used, but can include:
        \n\tAccelerometer data, sampled at the fastest rate
        \n\tGyroscope data, sampled at the fastest rate
        \n\tGPS position data, sampled at approximately 1Hz
        \n\tAudio data, sampled at 100-200Hz - the highest amplitude component within the sampling time window only

        \n\nA unique identifier is used per phone, so that multiple uses of the same phone can be correlated and combined.

        \n\nAll data is saved on the phone locally, then after the user stops the logging session and the phone subsequently
        enters a WiFi zone, the saved data is uploaded to our servers only.

        \n\nThe data saved on our server will not be shared with any third party without further consultation with the users.

        \n\nThe data from multiple logging events from the same user will be combined to produce aggregate data about the
        environment in which the user is located, but not about the user themselves.

        \n\nAll data is transmitted securely.\n</string>
